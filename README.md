# 📊 Customer Clustering App

This is a simple clustering application built using **Gradio**, which allows you to cluster customer credit card data using three algorithms:
- **KMeans**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔐 **Secure login system** (Username: `kavin`, Password: `1234`).
- 🚀 Supports multiple clustering algorithms.
- 📈 Easy-to-use interface to input feature values.
- 🎯 Shows predicted cluster or indicates outlier status.
- 📊 Visualizes results with scatter plots (optional extension).

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install gradio pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

---
## 🌐 Access the App

👉 Open your browser and visit:  
[http://127.0.0.1:7864](http://127.0.0.1:7863)

## 🧑‍💻 Login Credentials

- ✅ Username: `kavin`
- ✅ Password: `1234`

---

## 📝 Notes

- After successful login, the feature input fields and algorithm selector will appear.
- KMeans requires number of clusters (`k`) input.
- DBSCAN returns an OUTLIER message if the data point is too far from clusters.
- Designed for clustering customer credit card usage data.
